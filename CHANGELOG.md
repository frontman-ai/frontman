## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-19


#### @frontman/bindings


### Patch Changes

- [#393](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/pull/393) [`d4cd503`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/d4cd503c97e14edc4d4f8f7a2d5b9226a1956347) Thanks [@BlueHotDog](https://github.com/BlueHotDog)! - Fix Astro integration defaulting to dev host instead of production when FRONTMAN_HOST is not set, which broke production deployments. Also add stderr maxBuffer enforcement to spawnPromise to prevent unbounded memory growth from misbehaving child processes.

#### @frontman/client


### Minor Changes

- [#391](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/pull/391) [`9bcc19a`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/9bcc19ab3681673f1e63451c6b7d3c25007af130) Thanks [@itayadler](https://github.com/itayadler)! - Add Heap Analytics integration with automatic user identification. Heap is initialized in the client bundle with environment-aware env IDs (dev vs production). When a user session connects, the client fetches the user profile and calls `heap.identify()` and `heap.addUserProperties()` with the user's ID, email, and name. The server's `/api/user/me` endpoint now returns `id` and `name` in addition to `email`, and the user profile is stored in global state for reuse across components.

- [#368](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/pull/368) [`ef6f38d`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/ef6f38dc0ec0de5a98bca31dad576ee9e14ed0e8) Thanks [@BlueHotDog](https://github.com/BlueHotDog)! - Add device mode / viewport emulation to the web preview. Developers can now simulate specific device viewports (phones, tablets, desktop) with 12 built-in presets, custom dimensions, and orientation toggle. The preview iframe auto-scales to fit the available space with a checkerboard background. Device mode state is per-task, so switching tasks restores that task's viewport. A new `set_device_mode` MCP tool allows the AI agent to programmatically change viewports with actions for presets, custom sizes, responsive mode, orientation, and listing available devices.

### Patch Changes

- [#394](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/pull/394) [`40abf99`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/40abf99f81731557d57f44288de98af50220660c) Thanks [@itayadler](https://github.com/itayadler)! - Fix web preview URL bar syncing so iframe link navigations update the displayed URL without forcing iframe reloads. The URL input is now editable and supports Enter-to-navigate while preserving in-iframe navigation state.

#### @frontman/context-loader


### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [[`d4cd503`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/d4cd503c97e14edc4d4f8f7a2d5b9226a1956347)]:
  - @frontman/bindings@0.1.1

#### @frontman-ai/astro


### Patch Changes

- [#393](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/pull/393) [`d4cd503`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/d4cd503c97e14edc4d4f8f7a2d5b9226a1956347) Thanks [@BlueHotDog](https://github.com/BlueHotDog)! - Fix Astro integration defaulting to dev host instead of production when FRONTMAN_HOST is not set, which broke production deployments. Also add stderr maxBuffer enforcement to spawnPromise to prevent unbounded memory growth from misbehaving child processes.

#### @frontman/frontman-core


### Patch Changes

- [#388](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/pull/388) [`cf885f6`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/cf885f65e54bb1bb579448d882d9a60d8a5e14cf) Thanks [@itayadler](https://github.com/itayadler)! - fix: resolve Dependabot security vulnerabilities

  Replace deprecated `vscode-ripgrep` with `@vscode/ripgrep` (same API, officially renamed package). Add yarn resolutions for 15 transitive dependencies to patch known CVEs (tar, @modelcontextprotocol/sdk, devalue, node-forge, h3, lodash, js-yaml, and others). Upgrade astro, next, and jsdom to patched versions.

- Updated dependencies [[`d4cd503`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/d4cd503c97e14edc4d4f8f7a2d5b9226a1956347)]:
  - @frontman/bindings@0.1.1

## [0.4.1] - 2026-02-17


#### @frontman/client


### Patch Changes

- [#384](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/pull/384) [`59ee255`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/59ee25581b2252636fb7cacb5cec118a38c00ced) Thanks [@BlueHotDog](https://github.com/BlueHotDog)! - fix(astro): load client from production CDN instead of localhost

  The Astro integration defaulted `clientUrl` to `http://localhost:5173/src/Main.res.mjs` unconditionally, which only works during local frontman development. When installed from npm, users saw requests to localhost:5173 instead of the production client.

  Now infers `isDev` from the host (matching the Vite plugin pattern): production host loads the client from `https://app.frontman.sh/frontman.es.js` with CSS from `https://app.frontman.sh/frontman.css`.

  Also fixes the standalone client bundle crashing with `process is not defined` in browsers by replacing `process.env.NODE_ENV` at build time (Vite lib mode doesn't do this automatically).

#### @frontman-ai/astro

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-17


#### @frontman/client


### Minor Changes

- [`99f8e90`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/99f8e90e312cfb2d33a1392b0c0a241622583248) Thanks [@BlueHotDog](https://github.com/BlueHotDog)! - Add file and image attachment support in the chat input. Users can attach images and files via drag & drop, clipboard paste, or a file picker button. Pasted multi-line text (3+ lines or >150 chars) is collapsed into a chip. Attachments are sent as ACP resource content blocks with base64-encoded blob data and rendered as thumbnails in both the input area and message history with a lightbox preview.

- [`99f8e90`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/99f8e90e312cfb2d33a1392b0c0a241622583248) Thanks [@BlueHotDog](https://github.com/BlueHotDog)! - Add cancel/stop generation support. Users can now stop an in-progress AI agent response by clicking a stop button in the prompt input. Implements the ACP `session/cancel` notification protocol for clean cancellation across client, protocol, and server layers.

- [#342](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/pull/342) [`023e9a4`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/023e9a49037f7303dd13b98a5cd21ac429249756) Thanks [@itayadler](https://github.com/itayadler)! - Add current page context to agent system prompt. The client now implicitly collects page metadata (URL, viewport dimensions, device pixel ratio, page title, color scheme preference, scroll position) from the preview iframe and sends it as an ACP content block with every prompt. The server extracts this data and appends a `[Current Page Context]` section to user messages, giving the AI agent awareness of the user's browsing context for better responsive design decisions and route-aware suggestions.

- [#372](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/pull/372) [`2fad09d`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/2fad09d2672ef61baddfabee93250a4dcd13e7a9) Thanks [@itayadler](https://github.com/itayadler)! - Add first-time user experience (FTUE) with welcome modal, confetti celebration, and provider connection nudge. New users see a welcome screen before auth redirect, a confetti celebration after first sign-in, and a gentle nudge to connect an AI provider. Existing users are auto-detected via localStorage and skip all onboarding flows.

### Patch Changes

- [#379](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/pull/379) [`68b7f53`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/68b7f53d10c82fe5b462021cc2e866c0822fa0d8) Thanks [@BlueHotDog](https://github.com/BlueHotDog)! - Fix source location detection for selected elements in Astro projects.
  - Refactor Astro integration from Astro middleware to Vite Connect middleware for more reliable request interception
  - Capture `data-astro-source-file`/`data-astro-source-loc` annotations on `DOMContentLoaded` before Astro's dev toolbar strips them
  - Add ancestor walk fallback (up to 20 levels) so clicking child elements resolves to the nearest annotated Astro component
  - Harden integration: `ensureConfig` guard for no-args usage, `duplex: 'half'` for POST requests, `headersSent` guard in error handler, skip duplicate capture on initial `astro:page-load`
  - Add LLM error chunk propagation so API rejections (e.g., oversized images) surface to the client instead of silently failing
  - Account for `devicePixelRatio` in screenshot scaling to avoid exceeding API dimension limits on hi-DPI displays

- [`99f8e90`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/99f8e90e312cfb2d33a1392b0c0a241622583248) Thanks [@BlueHotDog](https://github.com/BlueHotDog)! - Fixed click-through on interactive elements (links, buttons) during element selection mode by using event capture with preventDefault/stopPropagation instead of disabling pointer events on anchors

- [`99f8e90`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/99f8e90e312cfb2d33a1392b0c0a241622583248) Thanks [@BlueHotDog](https://github.com/BlueHotDog)! - Remove dead initialization timeout code (`StartInitializationTimeout`, `InitializationTimeoutExpired`, `ReceivedDiscoveredProjectRule`) that was never wired up — `sessionInitialized` is set via `SetAcpSession` on connection

- [#357](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/pull/357) [`ebec53a`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/ebec53afadc28ce8c4d09a89a107b721c1c23c38) Thanks [@itayadler](https://github.com/itayadler)! - Redesign authentication UI with dark Frontman branding. The server-side login page now features a dark theme with the Frontman logo and GitHub/Google OAuth buttons only (no email/password forms). Registration routes redirect to login. The root URL redirects to the sign-in page in dev and to frontman.sh in production. The client-side settings modal General tab now shows the logged-in user's email, avatar, and a sign-out button. The sign-out flow preserves a `return_to` URL so users are redirected back to the client app after re-authenticating.

- [#377](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/pull/377) [`15c3c8c`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/15c3c8ccaf8ff65a160981493b4d46d98de42be5) Thanks [@itayadler](https://github.com/itayadler)! - ### Fixed
  - Stream `tool_call_start` events to client for immediate UI feedback when the LLM begins generating tool calls (e.g., `write_file`), eliminating multi-second blank gaps
  - Show "Waiting for file path..." / "Waiting for URL..." shimmer placeholder while tool arguments stream in
  - Display navigate tool URL/action inline instead of hiding it in an expandable body

Both Astro and Next.js configs now assert at construction time that `clientUrl` contains the required `host` query param, using the URL API for proper query-string handling.

Protocol types are now the single source of truth, with schemas auto-generated from Sury types and validated in both ReScript and Elixir. Includes CI checks for schema drift and breaking changes.

#### @frontman-ai/vite


### Minor Changes

- [#355](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/pull/355) [`84b6d9b`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/84b6d9bc68bc17cc5eec3b81f0b06b057d1826a9) Thanks [@itayadler](https://github.com/itayadler)! - Add `@frontman-ai/vite` package — a ReScript-first Vite integration with CLI installer (`npx @frontman-ai/vite install`), replacing the old broken `@frontman/vite-plugin`.
  - Vite plugin with `configureServer` hook and Node.js ↔ Web API adapter for SSE streaming
  - Web API middleware serving Frontman UI, tool endpoints, and source location resolution
  - Config with automatic `isDev` inference from host (production = `api.frontman.sh`, everything else = dev)
  - CLI installer: auto-detects package manager, analyzes existing vite config, injects `frontmanPlugin()` call
  - Process shim for production client bundle (Vite doesn't polyfill Node.js globals in browser)
