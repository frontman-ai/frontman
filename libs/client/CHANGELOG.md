## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`99f8e90`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/99f8e90e312cfb2d33a1392b0c0a241622583248) Thanks [@BlueHotDog](https://github.com/BlueHotDog)! - Add file and image attachment support in the chat input. Users can attach images and files via drag & drop, clipboard paste, or a file picker button. Pasted multi-line text (3+ lines or >150 chars) is collapsed into a chip. Attachments are sent as ACP resource content blocks with base64-encoded blob data and rendered as thumbnails in both the input area and message history with a lightbox preview.

Users can now stop an in-progress AI agent response by clicking a stop button in the prompt input. Implements the ACP `session/cancel` notification protocol for clean cancellation across client, protocol, and server layers.

- [#342](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/pull/342) [`023e9a4`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/023e9a49037f7303dd13b98a5cd21ac429249756) Thanks [@itayadler](https://github.com/itayadler)! - Add current page context to agent system prompt. The client now implicitly collects page metadata (URL, viewport dimensions, device pixel ratio, page title, color scheme preference, scroll position) from the preview iframe and sends it as an ACP content block with every prompt. The server extracts this data and appends a `[Current Page Context]` section to user messages, giving the AI agent awareness of the user's browsing context for better responsive design decisions and route-aware suggestions.

- [#372](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/pull/372) [`2fad09d`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/2fad09d2672ef61baddfabee93250a4dcd13e7a9) Thanks [@itayadler](https://github.com/itayadler)! - Add first-time user experience (FTUE) with welcome modal, confetti celebration, and provider connection nudge. New users see a welcome screen before auth redirect, a confetti celebration after first sign-in, and a gentle nudge to connect an AI provider. Existing users are auto-detected via localStorage and skip all onboarding flows.

### Patch Changes

- [#379](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/pull/379) [`68b7f53`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/68b7f53d10c82fe5b462021cc2e866c0822fa0d8) Thanks [@BlueHotDog](https://github.com/BlueHotDog)! - Fix source location detection for selected elements in Astro projects.
  - Refactor Astro integration from Astro middleware to Vite Connect middleware for more reliable request interception
  - Capture `data-astro-source-file`/`data-astro-source-loc` annotations on `DOMContentLoaded` before Astro's dev toolbar strips them
  - Add ancestor walk fallback (up to 20 levels) so clicking child elements resolves to the nearest annotated Astro component
  - Harden integration: `ensureConfig` guard for no-args usage, `duplex: 'half'` for POST requests, `headersSent` guard in error handler, skip duplicate capture on initial `astro:page-load`
  - Add LLM error chunk propagation so API rejections (e.g., oversized images) surface to the client instead of silently failing
  - Account for `devicePixelRatio` in screenshot scaling to avoid exceeding API dimension limits on hi-DPI displays

- [`99f8e90`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/99f8e90e312cfb2d33a1392b0c0a241622583248) Thanks [@BlueHotDog](https://github.com/BlueHotDog)! - Fixed click-through on interactive elements (links, buttons) during element selection mode by using event capture with preventDefault/stopPropagation instead of disabling pointer events on anchors

- [`99f8e90`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/99f8e90e312cfb2d33a1392b0c0a241622583248) Thanks [@BlueHotDog](https://github.com/BlueHotDog)! - Remove dead initialization timeout code (`StartInitializationTimeout`, `InitializationTimeoutExpired`, `ReceivedDiscoveredProjectRule`) that was never wired up — `sessionInitialized` is set via `SetAcpSession` on connection

- [#357](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/pull/357) [`ebec53a`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/ebec53afadc28ce8c4d09a89a107b721c1c23c38) Thanks [@itayadler](https://github.com/itayadler)! - Redesign authentication UI with dark Frontman branding. The server-side login page now features a dark theme with the Frontman logo and GitHub/Google OAuth buttons only (no email/password forms). Registration routes redirect to login. The root URL redirects to the sign-in page in dev and to frontman.sh in production. The client-side settings modal General tab now shows the logged-in user's email, avatar, and a sign-out button. The sign-out flow preserves a `return_to` URL so users are redirected back to the client app after re-authenticating.

- [#377](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/pull/377) [`15c3c8c`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/15c3c8ccaf8ff65a160981493b4d46d98de42be5) Thanks [@itayadler](https://github.com/itayadler)! - ### Fixed
  - Stream `tool_call_start` events to client for immediate UI feedback when the LLM begins generating tool calls (e.g., `write_file`), eliminating multi-second blank gaps
  - Show "Waiting for file path..." / "Waiting for URL..." shimmer placeholder while tool arguments stream in
  - Display navigate tool URL/action inline instead of hiding it in an expandable body
