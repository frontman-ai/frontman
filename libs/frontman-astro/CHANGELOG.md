# @frontman-ai/astro

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#405](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/pull/405) [`8a68462`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/8a684623cde19966788d31fd1754d9dc94e0e031) Thanks [@BlueHotDog](https://github.com/BlueHotDog)! - ### Added
  - **Image saving via write_file** — LLM can now save user-pasted images to disk using a new `image_ref` parameter referencing attachment URIs (`attachment://{id}/{filename}`). The browser MCP server intercepts `write_file` calls containing `image_ref`, resolves image data from client state, and rewrites to base64 content before forwarding to the dev-server.
  - **Astro component props injection** — New Vite plugin that captures component display names and prop values during Astro rendering, giving the AI agent richer context when users click elements in the browser.
  - **ToolNames module** — Centralized all 12 tool name constants (7 server + 5 browser) into a shared `ToolNames` module in `frontman-protocol`, eliminating hardcoded string literals across packages.

  ### Changed
  - `write_file` tool now accepts optional `encoding` param (`"base64"` for binary writes) and validates mutual exclusion between `content` and `image_ref`.
  - `AstroAnnotations.loc` field changed from `string` to `Nullable.t<string>` to handle missing `data-astro-source-loc` attributes.
  - MCP server uses `switch` pattern matching consistently instead of `if/else` chains.
  - Task reducer uses `Option.getOrThrow` consistently for `id`, `mediaType`, and `filename` fields (crash-early philosophy).
  - Vite props injection plugin scoped to dev-only (`apply: 'serve'`) with `markHTMLString` guard for Astro compatibility.

## 0.1.7

### Patch Changes

- [#393](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/pull/393) [`d4cd503`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/d4cd503c97e14edc4d4f8f7a2d5b9226a1956347) Thanks [@BlueHotDog](https://github.com/BlueHotDog)! - Fix Astro integration defaulting to dev host instead of production when FRONTMAN_HOST is not set, which broke production deployments. Also add stderr maxBuffer enforcement to spawnPromise to prevent unbounded memory growth from misbehaving child processes.

## 0.1.6

### Patch Changes

- [#384](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/pull/384) [`59ee255`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/59ee25581b2252636fb7cacb5cec118a38c00ced) Thanks [@BlueHotDog](https://github.com/BlueHotDog)! - fix(astro): load client from production CDN instead of localhost

  The Astro integration defaulted `clientUrl` to `http://localhost:5173/src/Main.res.mjs` unconditionally, which only works during local frontman development. When installed from npm, users saw requests to localhost:5173 instead of the production client.

  Now infers `isDev` from the host (matching the Vite plugin pattern): production host loads the client from `https://app.frontman.sh/frontman.es.js` with CSS from `https://app.frontman.sh/frontman.css`.

  Also fixes the standalone client bundle crashing with `process is not defined` in browsers by replacing `process.env.NODE_ENV` at build time (Vite lib mode doesn't do this automatically).

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- [#379](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/pull/379) [`68b7f53`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/68b7f53d10c82fe5b462021cc2e866c0822fa0d8) Thanks [@BlueHotDog](https://github.com/BlueHotDog)! - Fix source location detection for selected elements in Astro projects.
  - Refactor Astro integration from Astro middleware to Vite Connect middleware for more reliable request interception
  - Capture `data-astro-source-file`/`data-astro-source-loc` annotations on `DOMContentLoaded` before Astro's dev toolbar strips them
  - Add ancestor walk fallback (up to 20 levels) so clicking child elements resolves to the nearest annotated Astro component
  - Harden integration: `ensureConfig` guard for no-args usage, `duplex: 'half'` for POST requests, `headersSent` guard in error handler, skip duplicate capture on initial `astro:page-load`
  - Add LLM error chunk propagation so API rejections (e.g., oversized images) surface to the client instead of silently failing
  - Account for `devicePixelRatio` in screenshot scaling to avoid exceeding API dimension limits on hi-DPI displays

- [`99f8e90`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/99f8e90e312cfb2d33a1392b0c0a241622583248) Thanks [@BlueHotDog](https://github.com/BlueHotDog)! - Fix missing `host` param in Astro config that caused the client to crash on boot. Both Astro and Next.js configs now assert at construction time that `clientUrl` contains the required `host` query param, using the URL API for proper query-string handling.
