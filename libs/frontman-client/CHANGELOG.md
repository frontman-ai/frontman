# @frontman-ai/frontman-client

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#555](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/pull/555) [`18054d0`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/18054d0bec4a971f1c1a676b02cfaea9833d4b66) Thanks [@BlueHotDog](https://github.com/BlueHotDog)! - Model ContentBlock as a discriminated union per ACP spec instead of a flat record with optional fields. Adds TextContent, ImageContent, AudioContent, ResourceLink, and EmbeddedResource variants with compile-time type safety. Wire format unchanged.

- [#604](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/pull/604) [`cea1cff`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/cea1cff2e7d84e5d66ffa42562a862f9fa447dac) Thanks [@BlueHotDog](https://github.com/BlueHotDog)! - Add ACP-compliant LoadSessionResponse type and unify model selection with SessionConfigOption. Replaces the bespoke /api/models REST endpoint with channel-based config option delivery via session/new, session/load responses and config_option_update notifications. Adds full type tree: SessionModeState, SessionMode, SessionConfigOption (grouped/ungrouped select with category enum), sessionLoadResult. Server pushes config updates after API key saves and OAuth connect/disconnect via PubSub.

- [#598](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/pull/598) [`418d99c`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/418d99cd9b48e6c7948cdddea97ca13bd0f079b4) Thanks [@BlueHotDog](https://github.com/BlueHotDog)! - Add interactive question tool as a client-side MCP tool. Agents can ask users questions via a drawer UI with multi-step navigation, option selection, custom text input, and skip/cancel. Includes history replay ordering fixes (flush TextDeltaBuffer at message boundaries, use server timestamps for tool calls) and disconnect resilience: unresolved tool calls are re-dispatched on reconnect via MCP tools/call, tool results carry \_meta with env API keys + model for agent resume after server restart, and persistence is moved to the SwarmAi runtime process (persist-then-broadcast) so data survives channel disconnects.

### Patch Changes

- [#573](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/pull/573) [`fbbc2f6`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/fbbc2f60f05f96b010fa4d593e6845fcfd8a8a2f) Thanks [@BlueHotDog](https://github.com/BlueHotDog)! - Add ACP elicitation protocol support and enforce compliance across server, protocol, and client layers. Wire up elicitation schema conversion, typed status constants, AgentTurnComplete notification, and idempotent TurnCompleted state transitions. Fix flaky tests and nil description handling in elicitation schemas.

- [#601](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/pull/601) [`15607ba`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/15607ba50fee4902372f0dcc2175d014396917d2) Thanks [@BlueHotDog](https://github.com/BlueHotDog)! - Make AgentMessageChunk content field required per ACP ContentChunk spec. Removes unnecessary option wrapper and simplifies downstream consumer code.

- [#607](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/pull/607) [`eec075b`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/eec075b7d246a584dd2a8c84919f5e22b63093ab) Thanks [@BlueHotDog](https://github.com/BlueHotDog)! - ### Fixed
  - **MCP `handleMessage` promise rejections are no longer silently swallowed** — async errors in the channel message handler are now caught, logged, and reported to Sentry instead of disappearing into an unhandled promise rejection that causes the agent to hang indefinitely.

- [#587](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/pull/587) [`08d8af6`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/08d8af6b4e0e1acf86480924514ffacca937de2b) Thanks [@BlueHotDog](https://github.com/BlueHotDog)! - Replace suspension/resume with blocking interactive tools, fix agent message loss on session reload
  - Interactive tools (e.g. question) block with a 2-minute receive timeout instead of suspending the agent
  - Remove ResumeContext, ETS suspension state, on_suspended callback, resume_execution
  - Simplify add_tool_result to return {:ok, interaction} directly (no resume signals)
  - Pass mcp_tool_defs through for execution mode lookups (interactive vs synchronous timeout)
  - Fix race condition: flush TextDeltaBuffer before LoadComplete to prevent agent messages from being silently dropped during history replay
  - Thread server timestamps through agent_message_chunk for correct message ordering
  - Add timestamp to agent_message_chunk in ACP protocol schema

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- [#455](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/pull/455) [`ed92762`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/ed92762d46a3d26957eba8e68077398628e74f30) Thanks [@BlueHotDog](https://github.com/BlueHotDog)! - Filter third-party errors from Frontman's internal Sentry reporting. Extracts shared Sentry types, config (DSN, internal-dev detection), and a `beforeSend` filter into `@frontman/bindings` so all framework integrations share a single source of truth. The filter inspects stacktrace frames and drops events that don't originate from Frontman code, preventing noise from framework internals (e.g. Next.js/Turbopack source-map WASM fetch failures). Both `@frontman-ai/nextjs` and `@frontman-ai/frontman-client` now use this shared filter.

- [#461](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/pull/461) [`746666e`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/746666eec12531c56835a7e0e4da25efa136d927) Thanks [@itayadler](https://github.com/itayadler)! - Enforce pure bindings architecture: extract all business logic from `@frontman/bindings` to domain packages, delete dead code, rename Sentry modules, and fix circular dependency in frontman-protocol.

- Updated dependencies [[`0e02a6a`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/0e02a6ab637979e8f1276390e8608d998ec6edc1)]:

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- [#452](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/pull/452) [`2d87685`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/2d87685c436281dda18f5416782d9f6b9d85bc1c) Thanks [@BlueHotDog](https://github.com/BlueHotDog)! - Fix 8 Dependabot security alerts by upgrading Sentry SDK from v8 to v9, sentry-testkit to v6, and adding yarn resolutions for vulnerable transitive dependencies (rollup, basic-ftp, minimatch, devalue, hono).

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#405](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/pull/405) [`8a68462`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/8a684623cde19966788d31fd1754d9dc94e0e031) Thanks [@BlueHotDog](https://github.com/BlueHotDog)! - ### Added
  - **Image saving via write_file** — LLM can now save user-pasted images to disk using a new `image_ref` parameter referencing attachment URIs (`attachment://{id}/{filename}`). The browser MCP server intercepts `write_file` calls containing `image_ref`, resolves image data from client state, and rewrites to base64 content before forwarding to the dev-server.
  - **Astro component props injection** — New Vite plugin that captures component display names and prop values during Astro rendering, giving the AI agent richer context when users click elements in the browser.
  - **ToolNames module** — Centralized all 12 tool name constants (7 server + 5 browser) into a shared `ToolNames` module in `frontman-protocol`, eliminating hardcoded string literals across packages.

  ### Changed
  - `write_file` tool now accepts optional `encoding` param (`"base64"` for binary writes) and validates mutual exclusion between `content` and `image_ref`.
  - `AstroAnnotations.loc` field changed from `string` to `Nullable.t<string>` to handle missing `data-astro-source-loc` attributes.
  - MCP server uses `switch` pattern matching consistently instead of `if/else` chains.
  - Task reducer uses `Option.getOrThrow` consistently for `id`, `mediaType`, and `filename` fields (crash-early philosophy).
  - Vite props injection plugin scoped to dev-only (`apply: 'serve'`) with `markHTMLString` guard for Astro compatibility.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`99f8e90`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/99f8e90e312cfb2d33a1392b0c0a241622583248) Thanks [@BlueHotDog](https://github.com/BlueHotDog)! - Add file and image attachment support in the chat input. Users can attach images and files via drag & drop, clipboard paste, or a file picker button. Pasted multi-line text (3+ lines or >150 chars) is collapsed into a chip. Attachments are sent as ACP resource content blocks with base64-encoded blob data and rendered as thumbnails in both the input area and message history with a lightbox preview.

Users can now stop an in-progress AI agent response by clicking a stop button in the prompt input. Implements the ACP `session/cancel` notification protocol for clean cancellation across client, protocol, and server layers.

### Patch Changes

- [#336](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/pull/336) [`b98bc4f`](https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman/commit/b98bc4f2b2369dd6bc448f883b1a7dce3476b5ae) Thanks [@BlueHotDog](https://github.com/BlueHotDog)! - Suppress Sentry error reporting during Frontman internal development via FRONTMAN_INTERNAL_DEV env var
