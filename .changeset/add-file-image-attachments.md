Add file and image attachment support in the chat input. Users can attach images and files via drag & drop, clipboard paste, or a file picker button. Pasted multi-line text (3+ lines or >150 chars) is collapsed into a chip. Attachments are sent as ACP resource content blocks with base64-encoded blob data and rendered as thumbnails in both the input area and message history with a lightbox preview.
