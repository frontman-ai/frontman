Filter third-party errors from Frontman's internal Sentry reporting. Extracts shared Sentry types, config (DSN, internal-dev detection), and a `beforeSend` filter into `@frontman/bindings` so all framework integrations share a single source of truth. The filter inspects stacktrace frames and drops events that don't originate from Frontman code, preventing noise from framework internals (e.g. Next.js/Turbopack source-map WASM fetch failures). Both `@frontman-ai/nextjs` and `@frontman-ai/frontman-client` now use this shared filter.
