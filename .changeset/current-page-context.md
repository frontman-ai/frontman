Add current page context to agent system prompt. The client now implicitly collects page metadata (URL, viewport dimensions, device pixel ratio, page title, color scheme preference, scroll position) from the preview iframe and sends it as an ACP content block with every prompt. The server extracts this data and appends a `[Current Page Context]` section to user messages, giving the AI agent awareness of the user's browsing context for better responsive design decisions and route-aware suggestions.
