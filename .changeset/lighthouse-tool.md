Add Lighthouse tool for web performance auditing. The `lighthouse` tool runs Google Lighthouse audits on URLs and returns scores (0-100) for performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO categories, along with the top 3 issues to fix in each category. In DevPod environments, URLs are automatically rewritten to localhost to avoid TLS/interstitial issues. The Next.js config now falls back to PHX_HOST for automatic host detection in DevPod setups.
