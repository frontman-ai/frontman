Add device mode / viewport emulation to the web preview. Developers can now simulate specific device viewports (phones, tablets, desktop) with 12 built-in presets, custom dimensions, and orientation toggle. The preview iframe auto-scales to fit the available space with a checkerboard background. Device mode state is per-task, so switching tasks restores that task's viewport. A new `set_device_mode` MCP tool allows the AI agent to programmatically change viewports with actions for presets, custom sizes, responsive mode, orientation, and listing available devices.
